## 🌟 Executive Summary: What LUMI Is & Why This Matters

### What is LUMI?
**LUMI** is an enterprise-grade AI pair programmer and autonomous agent framework engineered like a **Deterministic Game Engine Kernel**. Rather than treating agent interactions as loose async request/response wrappers or distributed microservices, LUMI treats every agent turn as an atomic frame tick (`tick()`), operates over a **16MB Zero-GC Contiguous ArrayBuffer Slab**, captures immutable game-save snapshots (`GameStateSnapshot`), and supports sub-millisecond ($< 0.05\text{ ms}$) state time-travel rollback (`rewindToSnapshot()`).

### The Core Problem in Modern AI Agents
Traditional agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, raw REST wrappers) suffer from systemic architectural friction:
- **Framework Soup & RPC Overhead**: Uncoordinated micro-packages introduce $14\text{ ms} - 500\text{ ms}$ of dispatch latency before any LLM model even begins thinking.
- **State Drift & Ghost Edits**: Multi-turn agent loops easily lose context, get stuck in edit loops, or produce un-reproducible states when tool actions fail.
- **Garbage Collection (GC) Latency Spikes**: Generating thousands of dynamic V8 heap objects per turn triggers Node.js garbage collection sweeps, causing stutter and high memory pressure during live streaming.
- **Costly Re-runs**: When an agent makes a mistake on turn 8, traditional systems require restarting the entire session from scratch ($285\text{ ms} - \text{seconds}$ of re-parsing and re-execution).

### Why LUMI's Architecture Matters
1. **For Developers & Engineers**:
   - **Instant Feedback & Sub-Millisecond Speed**: Local orchestration overhead is slashed to **$0.17\text{ ms}$** ($>5,700\text{ frames/second}$), making the CLI and programmatic SDK feel instantaneously responsive.
   - **Zero-Friction State Rewind**: Rewind state to any earlier checkpoint in **$0.027\text{ ms}$** via `/rewind`. Staged virtual files, transcripts, and memory facts roll back in a single frame.
   - **Polished Terminal Experience**: Differential screen rendering with zero visual flicker, dynamic borders that never wrap on split screens, and ANSI syntax highlighting with continuation gutters.

2. **For AI Systems & Researchers**:
   - **Enabling High-Frequency Search**: High-level reasoning strategies like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), A* pathfinding, and autonomous multi-branch exploration require running hundreds of simulated rollouts. By removing IPC and GC overhead, researchers can run dense tree searches locally.
   - **Hard Determinism**: Seeded simulations, exact composition manifests (142/142 components), and fail-closed completion gates guarantee 100% reproducible execution traces.

3. **For Enterprises & Technology Leaders**:
   - **Maximized Compute Efficiency**: Running $>5,700$ frames/second on a single core allows running dense multi-agent swarms without expensive cloud infrastructure clusters.
   - **Enterprise Security**: Native PKCE OAuth 2.0 with credentials stored locally with 0600 file permissions and zero secret leakage in progress event streams.
   - **Permanent Open Innovation**: Licensed under Apache 2.0 and backed by a defensive patent non-aggression pledge.

## 1. Architectural Principles & Invariants

The LUMI runtime is engineered for high-frequency execution with deterministic, predictable performance characteristics:

1. **Zero-GC Contiguous Slab Memory**: A dedicated 16MB `ArrayBuffer` slab is initialized upon startup. String and node allocations write directly into structured typed array views (`Uint32Array` and `Uint8Array`), eliminating heap allocation churn and V8 garbage collection pauses during agent execution ticks.
2. **Sub-Millisecond Mean Tick Latency**: Turn dispatch, prompt composition, and fact storage execute in $< 1.0\text{ ms}$ on the local fast path (**$0.17\text{ ms}$ measured**).
3. **High-Throughput Execution**: The monolith exceeds $1,000\text{ frames/second}$ execution throughput (**$5,761.61\text{ fps}$ measured**).
4. **$O(1)$ State Rewind**: Time-travel rollback restores conversation frames, VFS staging layers, and memory stores in $< 0.10\text{ ms p95}$ (**$0.027\text{ ms p95}$ measured**).
5. **Zero Barrel Imports (ADR-012)**: Strictly disallows index barrel re-exports to eliminate circular initialization hazards and optimize tree-shaking and module loading latency.
6. **Base Class Immutability**: Foundational abstract classes (`AbstractAgentEngine`, `AbstractSessionStore`, `AbstractHands`) remain pure, extensible interfaces without ad-hoc coupling.

## 2. Substrate & Memory Allocation Engine

### 2.1 Arena Allocator (`src/sessions/extensions/substrate/arena-allocator.ts`)
The `ArenaAllocator` operates over a single fixed-capacity `ArrayBuffer` (default: `16,777,216 bytes`).

- **Static Zero-GC Encoding**: Retains static, reusable `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder("utf-8")` instances across all invocations, eliminating per-turn object allocations.
- **Direct Slab Writes**: Allocates strings and binary payloads directly into the slab's byte view with bounds verification.
- **Bounds-Checked Slices**: Exposes `readString(byteOffset, byteLength)` for zero-copy deserialization.
- **Offset Rewind**: Resets memory allocations via `setOffset(offsetWords)` during state rollback in $O(1)$ complexity.

```typescript
// Memory Slab Layout
// [ Offset 0 ........................................ 16MB Capacity ]
// [ Node View (Uint32Array) ][ Byte View (Uint8Array) ][ Free Space ]
```

### 2.2 Write Coalescing Substrate (`src/sessions/extensions/substrate/write-coalescer.ts`)
To protect NVMe/SSD storage and prevent I/O blocking during rapid turns, the write-behind buffer:
- Deduplicates file mutations via bitwise **FNV-1a 32-bit fast hashing** (`calculateFastHash`).
- Debounces file flushes (`debounceMs: 300ms`, `maxDelayMs: 2000ms`).
- Applies `.unref()` to internal timers to ensure clean process termination when the CLI exits.

## 3. Executive Terminal User Interface (TUI)

### 3.1 Differential Rendering Engine (`src/tui/tui-alt-screen.ts`)
The interactive TUI operates on an alternate terminal screen buffer (`\x1b[?1049h`), using synchronized output fencing (`\x1b[?2026h` / `\x1b[?2026l`) to eliminate visual tearing:
- **Cell Matrix Diffing**: Only changed terminal character cells are emitted over stdout.
- **Adaptive Width Borders**: Components like `AgentActivityTimeline` dynamically scale box width (`Math.max(24, Math.min(width, 100))`), adapting seamlessly between split-screen terminals and ultra-wide viewports.
- **Scrollback Geometry**: The `ScrollView` component supports auto-scroll pinning (`scrollToEnd()`), viewport jump commands (`Home` / `End`), and page-relative scrolling (`PgUp` / `PgDn` / `Shift+Up/Down` / `Ctrl+U/D`).

### 3.2 Syntax Highlighting & Continuation Gutters (`src/tui/syntax-highlighter.ts`)
- **Zero-Dependency Highlighting**: Built-in ANSI lexers for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Bash/Shell, Git Diffs, JSON, HTML, and CSS.
- **Continuation Guttering**: Long code lines wrapped across terminal widths are prefixed with `↳ ` continuation gutters to preserve visual boundary indentation.

## 4. State Rewind & Snapshot Time-Travel System

The monolith supports full-spectrum state checkpoints:

1. **Snapshot Creation**: Calling `monolith.createSnapshot()` captures:
   - Frame turn index counter.
   - Active message array and durable transcript log.
   - Staged Virtual File System ([SessionVfs](../src/sessions/extensions/vfs/session-vfs.ts)) modifications.
   - Cognitive memory facts and rules ([SessionMemoryStore](../src/sessions/extensions/memory/session-memory-store.ts)).
   - Active slab buffer offset word pointer.
2. **Snapshot Storage Index**: Checkpoints are stored in memory and indexed by session ID in `SnapshotStorageIndex`.
3. **Holistic Rollback**: Calling `monolith.rewindToSnapshot(snapshot)` restores:
   - Message history and transcript indexes.
   - Frame turn counter.
   - Memory facts categorized by rules, troubleshooting, and user facts.
   - Virtual filesystem staged files.
   - Arena allocator word pointer.
