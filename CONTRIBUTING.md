## Architectural Principles & Rules

### 1. 3-Tier Monolith Architecture
- Code is divided strictly across **3 Operational Tiers**: `src/agents/`, `src/sessions/`, and `src/tooling/`.
- Tiers can expand organically with specialized classes as needed, provided every class strictly models the **Deterministic Game Engine Strategy**.

### 2. Deterministic Game Engine Strategy
- Agent execution is modeled as a deterministic tick loop (`tick()`).
- All state updates must be snapshot-compatible via `GameStateSnapshot` and `rewindToSnapshot()`.
- Top-level composition is wired via `MonolithFactory` in `src/factories/monolith-factory.ts`.

### 3. Object-Oriented Class Extension (`extends`)
- Pure base parent contracts reside in `src/core/contracts/` and `src/core/abstracts/` (`AbstractAgentEngine`, `AbstractSessionStore`, `AbstractHands`, `AbstractEars`, `AbstractToolRegistry`).
- Specialized capabilities inherit downward (`class Child extends Parent`) in `src/*/extensions/`.

### 4. Mandatory Performance SLAs & Security Guardrails (`ADR-051`)
- **Current Verified Baseline (2026-08-16T07:24:39.847Z)**: **382/382** composition manifest, **9/9** smoke checks, **5/5** benchmark cases, **8/8** Flappy assertions, **6/6** guardrails.
- The current composition manifest expects **382/382** required capabilities.
- Live baseline metrics ([`docs/LIVE_BASELINE.json`](docs/LIVE_BASELINE.json)) are host-sensitive measurements, not fixed promises.
- Fast-path mean latency must remain below **1.0 ms**, deterministic throughput must remain at or above **1,000 frames/second**, and warmed state rewind p95 must remain below **0.1 ms**.
- The full verification suite runs on every PR via [`.github/workflows/repo-protection-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/repo-protection-ci.yml).
- **Zero-GC Slab Memory Invariant**: `PersistentSessionStore` slab allocation MUST remain fixed at **$16\text{ MB}$** (`16,777,216 bytes`).
- **Zero-Barrel Imports (`ADR-012`)**: Intermediate `index.ts` re-export barrel files inside `src/*/extensions/` are strictly prohibited.
- **Erasable TypeScript Syntax**: Forbidden syntax includes `enum`, `namespace`, parameter properties in constructors (`constructor(public x: string)`), `import =`, `export =`. Use `verbatimModuleSyntax` with top-level explicit type imports.

### 5. Agent Activity Streaming Contract (`ADR-082`)

- Preserve stable `activityId` values across started, updated, and completed notifications; renderers must upsert rather than append duplicates.
- Treat `item.completed` as authoritative for that item only; it cannot complete the provider turn or engine frame. Use monotonically increasing `sequence` values to reject stale updates.
- Keep `phase` (what kind of work) separate from `status` (where it is in its lifecycle).
- Publish success only after the provider turn terminal and non-empty final-response validation. A partial message, completed item, stream EOF, HTTP 200, or resolved promise is not sufficient.
- Keep a retriable attempt failure activity-scoped. Preserve one logical turn ID and one increasing sequence across the initial dispatch and fallback.
- Read and propagate `EngineTickResult.outcome`; failed and cancelled results may resolve with safe guidance in `response`.
- Never place raw chain-of-thought, command output, MCP arguments/results, credentials, or full assistant responses in progress events.
- Sanitize and bound every user/provider-derived label through `sanitizeProgressText()` even if an upstream adapter already sanitized it.
- Cancellation, timeout, provider failure, and missing credentials must emit explicit terminal activities and settle active child rows.
- Keep `AbortSignal` and callbacks local; do not serialize them through `RemoteSessionHandle` without a dedicated protocol contract.

Read the [Agent Activity Streaming Strategy](.wiki/agent/streaming-activity-strategy.md) before changing provider streaming, progress types, or terminal rendering.

## Development & Verification Workflow

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

### 2. Type-Checking

Run full TypeScript compilation check without emitting JS files:

```bash
npm run check
```

### 3. Run Automated Repository Guardrail Audit & Performance Test

Execute the mandatory pre-commit protection audit verifying type safety, performance SLAs ($< 1.0\text{ ms}$ latency), zero-GC slab memory invariants, and zero-barrel import compliance:

```bash
npm test
```

### 4. Interactive Tools & Benchmarks

```bash
# Launch interactive setup wizard (Model Providers & Codex OAuth)
lumi --setup

# Run the hermetic engine benchmark and throughput suite
npm run benchmark

# Verify current composition and critical runtime capability contracts
npm run smoke

# Run smoke, benchmark, and architecture guardrails and publish the live baseline
npm run baseline:update
```

The latest checked-in run (2026-08-16T04:01:32.434Z) passed 302/302 composition entries, 9/9 smoke checks, 5/5 benchmark cases, 8/8 deep assertions for the generated 12-file Flappy Bird React + TypeScript + Vite project, and 6/6 guardrails. Treat timings as host-sensitive; consult `docs/LIVE_BASELINE.json` instead of copying them into source documentation.

### 5. Streaming Regression Checklist

Changes to `EngineProgressEvent`, `AgentEngine`, the Codex adapter, cancellation, or the TUI require interactive coverage in addition to the standard commands:

1. Authenticated completion with a completed message candidate, provider turn terminal, validated answer, and `outcome: "completed"`.
2. Tool execution with one identity-updated row and no command output leakage.
3. `Esc` cancellation of a long-running command with no orphan child process.
4. Completed message followed by more item activity, proving the message frame does not end the turn.
5. Provider terminal without a final message, premature EOF, empty HTTP success, timeout, and missing-credential failures.
6. Retriable first-attempt failure followed by fallback success, plus exhausted-retry failure; only one turn-scoped terminal may appear.
7. Credential-redaction cases covering headers, keys, JWTs, URLs, query strings, environment assignments, and CLI flags.

## Git Commit Guidelines

Commit messages must follow the conventional commit format:

```text
{feat,fix,docs}[(ai,tui,agent,coding-agent)]: <commit message>
```

Examples:
- `feat(agent): add frame snapshot rewind support`
- `fix(tooling): correct line-anchored hash verification in hands`
- `docs(agent): update API reference guide in wiki`
