# Key Architectural Findings & Osmosis Audit

This document records the foundational research findings and lessons learned during the migration from early multi-agent experiments to the 3-tier monolithic Deterministic Game Engine architecture in `/Users/bozoegg/Desktop/LUMI-NEW`.

## 1. Why Multi-Agent Framework Experiments Failed

In earlier iterations, attempting to partition simple coding tasks across 6+ specialized agent micro-services resulted in severe structural failures:

1. **Context Fragmentation**: Agents lost track of system prompt rules and conversation turns across inter-agent RPC calls.
2. **Framework Bloat & Latency**: Serializing turns over multiple async event buses added 100ms+ latency overhead per turn.
3. **Uncoordinated State Mutations**: Multiple agents modified files simultaneously, leading to race conditions and file content corruption.

### The Monolithic Solution
Consolidating into a 3-tier monolithic framework (`agents`, `sessions`, `tooling`) with a **strict cap of $\le 5$ orchestrating classes per tier directory** eliminated multi-service overhead while retaining full modularity.

## 2. Key Insights Absorbed from `pi-main` (Teacher Model)

By running 5 passes of the **Osmosis Learning Methodology** against `/Users/bozoegg/Downloads/pi-main`, we isolated key production capabilities and discarded framework complexity:

- **Pass 1 (Context Compaction)**: Compacts turn history dynamically when turn threshold is exceeded ([SessionCompactor](../../src/sessions/extensions/compaction/session-compactor.ts)).
- **Pass 2 (Model Resolution & Branching)**: Fallback model resolution chain (`gemini-3.6-flash` $\rightarrow$ `gemini-1.5-pro`) and isolated session branching (`fork()`) ([ModelResolver](../../src/agents/extensions/resolution/model-resolver.ts)).
- **Pass 3 (VFS & Slash Router)**: In-memory Virtual File System staging overlays (`SessionVfs`) and sub-millisecond slash command routing (`AgentSlashRouter`).
- **Pass 4 (Long-Term Memory & KIs)**: Persistent memory fact storage and Knowledge Item indexing (`SessionMemoryStore`).
- **Pass 5 (Monorepo Package Absorption)**: Line-anchored hash verification (`hashline`), type-safe schema validation (`omptype`), file storage (`session-backends`), and JSON-RPC telemetry (`protocol`).

## 3. The Deterministic Game Engine Paradigm

Capturing agent turns as frame steps (`tick()`) and session states as immutable snapshots (`GameStateSnapshot`) proved to be the ultimate architecture for AI agent stability.

- **Predictable Execution**: Every tick follows the invariant lifecycle: `preTick() -> executeTick() -> postTick()`.
- **Zero-Drift Rewind**: `rewindToSnapshot()` allows instantaneous time-travel to any previous frame without side-effect leakage.

## 4. Why a Single “Thinking” Spinner Failed

A transient spinner label hid the difference between authentication, connection, planning, tool execution, file mutation, response generation, timeout, and cancellation. When a provider paused between events, the interface looked frozen even though the turn was still live. When dispatch failed before response generation, the same generic label concealed the actual failure boundary.

The durable solution is an identity-based activity lifecycle:

- Provider item IDs become stable `activityId` values.
- `started`, `in_progress`, and terminal events update one persistent row.
- A per-turn `sequence` prevents late updates from rolling the UI backward.
- Turn-level completion, failure, and cancellation settle all visible work.
- The final response remains separate from the progress channel.

This provides useful visibility without exposing raw command output, tool data, credentials, or hidden reasoning. It also keeps provider fidelity honest: Codex SDK dispatch can show item-level work, while basic HTTP dispatch reports only request-level status.
